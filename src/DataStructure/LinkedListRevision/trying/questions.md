Question 1
Given an unsorted circular linked list, suppose you have reference (or pointer) to its head node only, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time if no overwriting of nodes data is allowed.
i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

Answer is None of the above

# Question 2
In doubly linked lists, traversal can be done in ?
Ans Both direction

# Question 3 
Given an unsorted doubly Linked List, suppose you have references (or pointer) to its head and tail nodes, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time ?
i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

Ans all of the above

# Question 4
What are the time complexities of finding 6th element from beginning and 6th element from end in a singly linked list? Let n be the number of nodes in linked list, you may assume that n > 7.

Answer is O(1) and O(n)

# Question 5
The concatenation of two lists is to be performed in O(1) time. Which of the following implementations of a list should be used?
answer 
circular Doubly linked list 

Resign Singly-linked list cannot be answer because we cannot find last element of a singly linked list in O(1) time. Doubly linked list and Circular Linked List cannot also not be answer because of the same reason as singly linked list.
